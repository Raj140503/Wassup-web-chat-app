# 🚀 Wassup - Real-Time Web Chat App

In a world that’s constantly connected, messaging apps are the digital bridges between us. Whether it's work, friends, or fun, real-time communication is essential. So I decided to dive deep into the world of **WebSockets**, and out of that curiosity was born **Wassup** — a minimal, real-time web chat app built from scratch using **Socket.io**, **Node.js**, and **Express**.

This project isn't just another chat app — it's a **learning journey turned into code**. I wanted to build something functional yet clean, lightweight yet engaging. With features like live user join alerts, real-time messaging, typing indicators, and a responsive layout, *Wassup* delivers just what you need for instant communication — no fluff, just function.

Whether you're a developer wanting to explore **real-time communication with Socket.io**, or someone curious to see how a basic chat system works behind the scenes, this project is for you.

So go ahead, clone it, play with it, break it, rebuild it — and if you love it, contribute to it! 🚀
